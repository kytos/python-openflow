    The experimenter field is a 32-bit value that uniquely identifies the
    experimenter. If the most significant byte is zero, the next three bytes
    are the experimenterâ€™s IEEE OUI. If the most significant byte is not zero,
    it is a value allocated by the Open Networking Foundation. If experimenter
    does not have (or wish to use) their OUI, they should contact the Open
    Networking Foundation to obtain an unique experimenter ID.

    The rest of the body is uninterpreted by standard OpenFlow processing and
    is arbitrarily defined by the corresponding experimenter.

    If a switch does not understand an experimenter extension, it must send an
    OFPT_ERROR message with a OFPBRC_BAD_EXPERIMENTER error code and
    OFPET_BAD_REQUEST error type.
